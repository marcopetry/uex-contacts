# Contact List - IndexedDB Study

This project aims to study IndexedDB in the browser using a repository system on the front end. The application consists of a contact list that allows adding, editing, removing, and searching for contacts stored locally in IndexedDB.

## Technologies Used

The project was developed using the following technologies:

- **React 19** - Library for building the interface.
- **Material UI (MUI)** - Styled component framework for React.
- **React Hook Form** - Library for form management.
- **Zod** - Data schema validation.
- **TanStack Query & Router** - Asynchronous state management and routing.
- **Axios** - HTTP client for requests.
- **IndexedDB** - Browser local database for offline storage.

## Dependencies

### Styling

- **@emotion/react** & **@emotion/styled**: Used for dynamic component styling.
- **@mui/material** & **@mui/icons-material**: UI components and icons based on Material Design.

### State Management and Routing

- **@tanstack/react-query**: Cache management and asynchronous requests.
- **@tanstack/react-router**: React-based routing for navigation in the application.

### Forms and Validation

- **react-hook-form**: Efficient form management.
- **@hookform/resolvers**: Integration of react-hook-form with validation libraries.
- **zod**: Definition and validation of data schemas.

### Integrations and Utilities

- **axios**: HTTP client for external API communication.
- **js-cookie**: Cookie management for data persistence.
- **@vis.gl/react-google-maps**: Integration with Google Maps for contact location.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the project:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## Study Objective

This project explores the use of **IndexedDB** in the browser for persistent and efficient data storage, along with the implementation of **repositories** on the front end to standardize communication with the local database. The study also covers best practices in building forms, data validation, and state management in React.
